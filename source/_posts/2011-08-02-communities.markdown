I'm a talkative person. I like to share time with fellows that share some interest with me. Despite of that, it took me like 4 years to be active on my Ruby community. 

If I remember correctly, at beginning of 2011, after a couple of beers, talking with other Rubyist, we decided to try to organize the RubyConf in Argentina. We had an excellent time last year in Uruguay, that we thought we should give it a shot. 

This way I started joining the other organizers every Friday at Urban Station. Talking about the conference lead us to also talk about personal life, and other things. So we bonded. We eat, drink and talk about many topics, and enjoy most of our talks. 

You could say that most programmers are introvert people... but I am not.
