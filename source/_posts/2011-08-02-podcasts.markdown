Clearly, there are lots of sources of information on the web. Blogs, News feeds, Twitter, forums, podcasts, screencasts, etc. 

With work, family, friends, and other related stuff, I don't have much time to exhaust all of them, so I have to choose. Since I ride a bike pretty much all the time, my favorite way of learning is by listening to some podcasts and by watching screencats. 

## Free
- [The Ruby Show](http://rubyshow.com/) from Jason Seifer and Peter Cooper.
- [The JavaScript Show](http://javascriptshow.com/) Same guys. 
- [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com) Good podcast featuring ruby personalities. 
- [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/) The latest news in the Ruby and Rails community
- [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/) with Wynn Netherland and Adam Stacoviak.
- [RailsCasts](http://www.railscasts.com) by Ryan Bates

## Paid
- [Destroy all software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com) from Gary Bernhardt. This like getting advice from a pro. Gary is super smart and talks about many topics. Ruby is one of them, but Python, VIM, and others are mentioned. 
- [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com) from Geoffrey Grosenbach. Do I really have to explain what peepcode is? Go, boy, get yourself an unlimited subscription right now.
