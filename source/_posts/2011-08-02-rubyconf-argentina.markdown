(This is not really a news, but something I really want to talk about)

The Ruby Argentina group is organizing the first RubyConf, here in Buenos Aires. 

RubyConf Argentina 2011 is a two-day event coming to Buenos Aires the 8th and 9th of November, focused on Ruby and modern web technologies related to the Ruby programming language.

The program is designed to cover the interests of a wide spectrum of programmers, from the new developer who is interested in learning Ruby for the first time to the long-time Ruby expert. The event is designed to open a dialogue between developers in Argentina and the rest of the world.

We have a big list of remarkable speakers, from Argentina and the world!
