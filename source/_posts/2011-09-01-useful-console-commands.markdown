## To be execute on bash or zsh, as far as I know

Go to the end of the line:
ctrl+e

Go to the beginning of the line:
`ctrl+a`

Move by one letters at a time:
`ctrl+f` (`ctrl+b` to go backwards)

Move by word
`alt+f` (`alt+b` to go backwards)

Delete words:
`alt+d` (remember that you need to be in the beginning of the word)


### Update (thanks to @etagwerker)

Shell History Reverse Search:
`ctrl+r` Start typing a previous command and it will look it up for you, so you just
press enter without having to write the whole (long ass) command again.
