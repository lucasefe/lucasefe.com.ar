Ok, a new release of ThemesForRails has been released. It took me a while, and may be because I am not use to deal with a open source project and my regular job (clearly, I need to take some classes from [@soveran](http://twitter.com/soveran) or [@luislavena](http://twitter.com/luislavena) (Tucuman's Ruby OSS Bot). Today, I've decided to do something about it. 

Any way, this release is mostly bugfixes and compatibility with rails 3.1. In the following days (or hours) I will release the new version for rails 3.2 (removing all the de deprecation warnings).

As usual: 

    gem install themes_for_rails 

Or update your app's Gemfile

    gem 'themes_for_rails', '0.4.3'

Cheers
