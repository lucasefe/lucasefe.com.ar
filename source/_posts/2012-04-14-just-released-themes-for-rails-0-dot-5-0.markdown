Hi, dear reader

Just writing about the new version of themes_for_rails gem. Since there has
been no major issues with the pre-release, I' releasing 0.5.0  right now. 

As usual, just do <code>gem install themes_for_rails</code> or update your
<code>Gemfile</code> file. 

Remember to take a look at the wiki page. There a lot of information regarding
upgrade and Assets Pipeline compatibility ([Wiki page](https://github.com/lucasefe/themes_for_rails/wiki))

Also, I already wrote about it on a previous post. [Check it out](/blog/2012/02/19/themes-for-rails-with-assets-pipeline-support/)

And, if in doubt, just leave a comment, or [tweet me](http://www.twitter.com/lucasefe).
