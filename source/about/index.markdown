<p>Well, my name is Lucas Florio, a.k.a Lucas Efe. I'm a programmer / musician. Love to solve problems. Love to create elegant solutions to complex problems. I enjoy working (mostly) with Ruby and now with JavaScript. Those are my favorite programming languages today... but that changes always. We change... so tomorrow could be something else, I don't know.</p>
