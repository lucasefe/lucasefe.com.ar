Well, my name is Lucas Florio, a.k.a Lucas Efe. I'm a programmer / musician. 

Love to solve problems. Love to create elegant solutions to complex problems. I enjoy working (mostly) with Ruby and now with JavaScript. Those are my favorite programming languages today... but that changes always. We change... so tomorrow could be something else, I don't know.

As a musician, I've always worked on my own musical projects. After struggling a lot with bands and the music industry in Argentina, I am taking some time to think what I really want to do. I still enjoy playing my dear Rickenbacker Bass whenever I have the time.

You can see some of my work on my [portfolio](/portfolio). And you can reach me
by email (lucasefe at gmail).

I might be looking for a job ;)
