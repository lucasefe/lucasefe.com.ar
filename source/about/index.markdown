Well, my name is Lucas Florio, a.k.a Lucas Efe. I'm a programmer / musician, and I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Love to solve problems. Love to create elegant solutions to complex problems. I enjoy working (mostly) with Ruby and now with JavaScript. Those are my favorite programming languages today... but that changes always. We change... so tomorrow could be something else, I don't know.

As a musician, I've always worked on my own musical projects. After struggling a lot with bands and the music industry in Argentina, I am taking some time to think what I really want to do. I still enjoy playing my dear Rickenbacker Bass whenever I have the time.

As a developer, I've been making web applications with Ruby for the last 6 years. I know my ways around all the layers involved on developing Web Apps.

###Specialties

* Ruby, Javascript
* Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Cuba
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript, jQuery, Prototype, Backbone.js
* SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
* Git, SVN, ClearCase.
* TDD & BDD
* Experience working with different Social Networks APIs

Also, I worked a few years ago as Network/System Administrator on many different systems. Windows, Linux, SQL Server, MySQL, Apache, nginx, IIS, Exchage, Postfix, just to name a few.

You can see some of my work on my [portfolio](/portfolio). And you can reach me by email (lucasefe at gmail).

I might be looking for a job ;)
